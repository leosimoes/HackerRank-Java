# HackerRank - Java - Object Oriented Programming - Method Overriding 2 (Super Keyword)

When a method in a subclass overrides a method in superclass, it is still possible to call the overridden method 
using `super` keyword. 

If you write `super.func()` to call the function `func()`, it will call the method that was defined in 
the superclass.

You are given a partially completed code in the editor. 

Modify the code so that the code prints the following text:

```
Hello I am a motorcycle, I am a cycle with an engine.
My ancestor is a cycle who is a vehicle with pedals.
```
